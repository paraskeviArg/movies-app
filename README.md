# movies-app
A full stack application developed in Java and JavaScript, based on the MVC model, using Spring. Also it is a first try getting into web development.  The goal was to make a web application that would allow someone to search a movie by its name or its plot, and they would get in return some information about that movie. The user can register and like or save his favorite movies. This data is stored in a database. The backend is developed using Java, while the front-end is based on the JQuery library and uses Ajax features too.
