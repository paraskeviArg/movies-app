# movies-app
  This is a full stack application developed in Java and JavaScript. This was my first university project regarding web-development. The goal was to make a web application that would allow someone to search a movie by it's name or it's plot, and they would get in return some information about that movie.
  The user can register and like or save his favorite movies. This data is stored in a database. The whole project is based on the MVC model, using the Spring framework.
  The backend is developed using Java, while the front-end is based on the JQuery library and uses Ajax features too.
  This is only a first encounter with those programming tools, if I would do it again, I would complete it differently for sure.
